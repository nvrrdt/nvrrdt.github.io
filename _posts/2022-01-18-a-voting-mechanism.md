The ultimate goal for the onze blockchain is setting up a global and local voting mechanism, as well in the basis for a voting mechanism of features to update or improve the code of onze.

So first the features voting: somehow an equilibrium should be reached where a feature is implemented by voting under willing coders (eventually with others voting at a lower importance), while a feature should also be undone when all the onze users vote therefor and reach a (let's say 51%) consensus.  
A list of all the historical coders should be kept (like in github or a decentralized alternative) and coders that are willing to vote form the board of willing coders and the president (the one willing with the most implemented features) oversees it all.  
Rewards should be foreseen, but if they want to work for onze or invoice onze that should be doable as well as onze is to become an official company, and this is difficult if coders would like to remain anonymous and being just rewarded in onze. It's like overruling the government which should be avoided unless a globally and incredably improved system is to arise (that's the reason I post this - to reach impossible improvement of fractionated governments).

These are the seeds for the features voting, which I like to pull through to other types of voting like the ones being organized locally by governments, but also the non-existing global type. And the 51% overrule exists for when the performers don't execute as planned or as thought. Daily voting is what I like to see, while per subject voting periods are to be established by experimentation.

We're one world, there's only one side on this world and it's the outerside, we must cooperate globally, we only need competition in inefficient markets (a poll will find this out, a voting mechanism doesn't differ much from a polling mechanisme in the basis).

It is a long process towards global happiness, but we have all the knowledge, now we need to puzzle until we don't feel the need to compete (or explore Newton's third law, it's also what tai chi stands for if I fully understood).

We may discuss this further on twitter! @nvrrdt  
Your thoughts and ideas are well appreciated.
