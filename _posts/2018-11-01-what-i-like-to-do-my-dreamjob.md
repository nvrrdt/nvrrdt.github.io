I wish I could find someone who's able to fullfil my well desired need to write down ideas and afterwards to try to develop those ideas programmatically.  
Right now I don't have the financial abilities nor the needed time, cause I need to work to have an income.

So my dreamjob is assembling ideas and be able to develop some of those ideas, I quite like that.

Not that I do like my job, I just like R&D more. Unfortunately the headhunters I spoke the last 15 years didn't want to put me in R&D, which is a shame.

A year ago I created a web app called [egoconf](https://github.com/egoconf/egoconf) and I really like to develop that further.
I have some other ideas, but thanks to my medical condition and a lack of time, I'm mostly unable to explore those paths deeper.
