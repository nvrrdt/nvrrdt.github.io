title: Please find me a product ...

Please give me time to work this out:  
At my current employer exists the problem to find built products in Europe.

My solution is to build a decentralised list of products that leave the factory and go to a certain site.  
When someone wants a product the peers will be flooded saying they want that product.  
When a product is taken, the peers will be flooded saying that product is taken.  
All peers should react with an ok or a not ok, when not ok, the cheapest transport cost should win, unless a theshold is passed when a certain site didn't get products for a long time.  

I have no idea what the other frictions are, but this is a basis where could be build upon.

Perhaps when the site, before transport to another site, gets an order, transport could be avoided ... I don't know.  
It's just about rules, but nobody should be excluded.
