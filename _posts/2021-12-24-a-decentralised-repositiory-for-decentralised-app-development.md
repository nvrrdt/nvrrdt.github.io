Github and derivatives are centralised.  

You need a decentralised alternative that even enables to pay it's developers, it could as well be that the public votes for acceptance of a patch.  

Voting is something special in the decentralised world, but this decentralised repository is a nice playground in order to master decentralised voting.  

My future plans in order to be financially able to fiddle with this idea: around March jumping into the KBC Startit program, I hope I succeed, then and within this program seeking for investors.  

Then I hope to become settled to fulfill my decentralised dreams until I retire which I hope to be far passed the by then official retirement age of 67. We'll see. The goal is to remain useful till 80 years old. We'll see.
