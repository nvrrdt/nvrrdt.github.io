Suppose you want to divide all riches with the aid of a cryptocoin and so that anyone can buy whatever is needed to live a wonderful life on the part of physical goods.  
You start to give out 1000 equicoins (from equilibrium) to 1000000 people who must know each other and connect to each other.  
You can upvote and downvote people preferably based on being rich or poor, rich and you get downvoted.  
The goal is to give the poorest of the poor the ability to build something with some cryptocoin.  
If you reach a certain amount of downvotes, then you're richer than them, based on social knowledge, then your amount of equicoins lowers.  
If this continues then the poorest get more coins and new coins must be mined to be able to share more equicoins among the poorest, so there's a natural trend to become richer.  
Until you get too rich and get downvotes.  
I don't propose a maximal amout of equicoins, also the speed of mining should be dynamic, based on the needs of the poorest.  
An exchange should exist where you can sell equicoins, you can't buy them as they are going to the poorest.  
A market should exist where you can buy things with equicoins, then those gained equicoins will be divided under the poorest by voting.  
You build riches for the poorest by effectively leveraging their (financial) possibilities, after a while an equilibrium is reached between rich and poor, the goal is to flatten out riches.  
That equilibrium must be reached to let people explore themself to the fullest, while getting very rich is discouraged as it is not needed to live a wonderful life, a full blossomful life.
