title: From quoate handling to order handling including middlemen

It's a well known problem, mostly in the ordering process, that people don't know what references, from i.e. seller, middleman and buyer, exactly mean and to what project or internal references they reference. It's a referencing problem.
I would propose hashing references and linking them to an array of needed dictionaries.
For projects consisting of multiple words you need a hash forest, to be able to search for every word in the forest.
Every entity should  be able to search for their own references and be able to see their concerned emails and in fact thus also the projectname and projectnumber, some metadata.

It is just that mailsystems right now don't streamline those workflows and should be superceded with an improved system. I'm willing to spend my paid time to R&D such a system.

What's interesting that this could be decentralised, in order to avoid external servers and so mails could be shared in a common mailbox.
Even a cryptocurrency could be involved to settle payments directly, but that's an whole other story.

So Outlook, I want to be a competitor ... no need for plugins. Just a dedicated piece of software.
