Everyone should communicate their margin on the things they sell.

From raw materials to salaries, everything should be public.

It's an optimisation of resources and avoiding greediness, a way of introducing all citizens to our system, a way to divide richess so everyone can have a quality life.

One company should start, it's nothing more than a webpage with bookkeeper data.

It's even possible to lower the margin in function of recent sales, a dynamic margin in fact, and the goal is to have a surviving company that can invest and doesn't build up profits (for the ceo/board).
