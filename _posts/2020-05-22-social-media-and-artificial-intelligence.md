I tried posting on facebook and I tried posting on linkedin, the net result is that I don't get reactions, I even think my friends have blocked from seeing my posts on facebook. It seems like all my postings are seen as a manifestation of my schizophrenia, I don't know.

And so I was thinking that I should only write on this blog, instead of posting on facebook or linkedin and let the interpretation of my postings be done by sporadic passers-by or artificial intelligence.

I know artificial intelligence is nowhere near a state that it can fully comprehend what I write, but I've got time and I might one day myself try to improve that artificial intelligence.

It's a shame that posting on facebook doesn't lead to fair and ameliorating discussion, it's a shame that there's also no discussion on linkedin unless you are a recruiter or an entrepreneur.

It all is so fractionated, there's not one platform that does it all and now there's a swarm of very loosely coupled websites, in my opinion too looslely coupled websites. But hey there are privacy concerns he, which I don't get, not at all. Privacy shouldn't count online, that's my utopia, not dystopia. I'm also a textual person and not so much a graphical person. Text is there in the long run, while graphics evade as an old memory.

On a sidenote: I'm now, since early January 2020, busy with the https://github.com/onzehub project, where the crowd module is of most importance, and this project will probably take a few years to being introduced in the market. I hope I will soon find an investor, a good investor, that let's me develop this fulltime, fulltime as I've had with employers who don't invest in code made by me. And onzehub is a blockchain platform, a blockchain who uses little computation compared to bitcoin and comparatives, that's the main difference. And rewards can also be scored as there's the concept of chosen_one's the coin module of onzehub.
