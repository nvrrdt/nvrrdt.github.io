I tried to find a way to easily describe my thoughts and the solution that suited my needs was a 'data:text/html, <html contenteditable>' page in a webbrowser. However I never saved my thoughts, which is really a shame..

So now I thought of a vue app that you open at localhost in the browser which is also an empty page where you can write thoughts, however it gets logged. Every 10 minutes a timestamp in the log on the server. I say server, a webserver, because I want these writings to be served to the public ip, in an ipv4 world this will not work as there's nat, but later on this should function.

My goal is to make all what you do on your computer public and I'd like to start with one place on your computer that is public. In a world full of secrets and passwords this goal is not reachable, but the moment you can 't spoof yourself and id's are effectively known in the computerworld, that 's the moment that this goal could become truth. But it doesn't have to.

This app, when on localhost you can write, when in the public you see the log and perhaps some other info like a normal webpage. When on localhost you start in write modus and ':exit' should get into blog modus.

I might once write a small book explaining a society without secrets, for me that 's the most efficient society. Secrets are resistance and don't help the common goal of humankind which is to explore the big and the small, the universe and the quantum world.
