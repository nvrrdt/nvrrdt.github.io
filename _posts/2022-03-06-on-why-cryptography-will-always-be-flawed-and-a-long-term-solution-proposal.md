title: on why cryptography will always be flawed and a long term  solution proposal

I don't think there's a solution for the cryptography problem, every solution is flawed. She who owns the network can always execute a man in the middle attack with the aid of entering someones computer to steal the necessary private key and even the strongest computer users won't be able to prevent this. That's why I prefer to overrule the cryptography problem with an operating system that makes every digital move public or open, a network of these computers will bring trustful honesty among its users, in my opinion which might also be flawed.
