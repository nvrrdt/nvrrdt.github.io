This is what will be my most important project, the rest is merely preparation.

News reminds us everyday of malicious hackers doing their thing. People capable of hacking will grow year by year. Therefore chances increase that every global single one will be hacked one day. Might become untenable. Improving software will most possibly introduce new undisclosed and exploitable bugs, unsolvable, untenable.

This is my solution: every online action is public good and you must know that a lot of stuff is online, just not always connected.  
If everything digital is public then there is a backtrace to what people do, no digital communication is hidden, it's untraditional and controversial, but in a world of malicious hackers the only way to be sure you're not being hacked and profited off.

So, create an operating system that puts every user interaction publicly online and foresee communication between people. Make this a secure happening. Like a facebook on steroids to a great deal of power but tailor made to the common person who has enough of uncertainty.

It's experimental, this software I'd like to create and prepare, might never be used. Unless no one knows anymore who has which information of who. No one and they're asking themselves how to get this straight, well this is my solution.

The road ahead is creating a c compiler (made of a machine code seed) which incorporates an early hash function, then create an operating system that sets up a decentralized blockchain spreading every user action over peers (ipfs wise). Starting the operating system should verify and compare the correctness of its binaries in the blockchain, that's where the hash function kicks in. In the basis I'd like to prepare this.

This will be my greatest project. It might be that I don't even produce one program, but I hope at least to write a book about this very controversial endeavour.
