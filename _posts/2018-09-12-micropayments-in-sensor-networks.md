title: Micropayments in sensor networks

The idea is to gather payments that don't surpass the price of a new sensor + a well explained fee for works
and this over the lifespan of the sensor, so a sensor with a really long lifespan shouldn't cost you more than a sensor with a short lifespan.
This is about honesty in your sensor service, to avoid greedyness.

This could also be about humans, where someone doesn't get more than he/she can use durably.
It should create a dynamic environment for you, where you get what you really need.

This looks really naive, I have no idea how to impose this, it's all about efficiency in a society and creating vacancies for interested persons.
