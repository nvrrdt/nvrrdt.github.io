Please give me time to work on this:  
Rocket to serve the index.html of a vue project, both in development and production.  
Rust as the backend language.  
You have to make libraries with rust and call those functions in vue with node-ffi.  
A simple command should start the rocket server and serve the index.html directly in a webbrowser.  
This should become a boilerplate for rust and vue projects.
I'd like to avoid to call functions through http with axios, as proposed by another project.
