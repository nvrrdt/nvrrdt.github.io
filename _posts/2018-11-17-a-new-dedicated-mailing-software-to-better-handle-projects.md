Please give me time to make this:  
Based on my rocket-vue should a mail based project management system be build.  
All mails should come from a mailserver as is usually done.  
The project details should be decentrally stored on every node's computer.  

There should be a project selector window as proposed by [conciseml](https://github.com/nvrrdt/conciseml).  
What should be denotable is the project, the products involved, who's involved in which product, the due date for every product, a list of the involved mails, may be an area to take notes.  
What I thought of is handling RFQ's - request for quotations.

Decentrally means that an ip adress should be put in initially in the program that leads to the whole network. Ip adresses of the whole decentral network should be kept.
